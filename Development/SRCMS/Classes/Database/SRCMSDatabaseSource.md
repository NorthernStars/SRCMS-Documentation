### deleteUser

Deletes a user from the database based on the provided `SRCMSUser` object and logs the action.

### getUserWithId

Fetches a user from the database based on the user ID, converts the cursor data to a `SRCMSUser` object, and returns it.

### getUserWithPin

Fetches a user from the database based on the user PIN, converts the cursor data to a `SRCMSUser` object, and returns it. Returns `null` if no user is found.

### isRootOnlyEntry

### cursorToUser

Converts cursor data to a `SRCMSUser` object, extracting user properties from the cursor.

### createPinMap

### getAllUser

Fetches all users from the database, converts the cursor data to a list of `SRCMSUser` objects, and returns the list.

### checkIfUserNameIsValid

## Conclusion

The `SRCMSDataSource` class provides a comprehensive set of methods for managing user data within the Social Robot CMS, facilitating database operations, and ensuring proper handling and validation of user information.
